# ai
working on the very beginning of ai

A being input from a user, and b being the definitions that most resemble the user input, simularity equation is applied and then the pair are placed in the txt file logc.txt which should then gets treatment against the whole database of words and their definitions...The error correction code isn't even started yet, so thats that...

Learning curve!*
This is a logical conclusion sequence about relating two databases, numbers, or anything actually. Which is what allows it to be the beginning of a database creation process for making ai smart!

 a=ab -> a=b -> a=b+-.x -> a=~b -> ab=b+-a -> b=ab+-.x*ab -> ab=/=a =~ (a=b as a=ab a=b a=b+-.x a=~b ab=b+-a b=ab+-.x*ab ab=/=a a=b)-+(a=ab a=b a=b+-.x a=~b ab=b+-a b=ab+-.x*ab ab=/=a a=b), putting a = b , (ab)=((a)errorcorrection) == (ab)=((b)errorcorrection) , cosinesimularity into a txtfile called logc with each entry as so; a = b|(ab)=((a)errorcorrection) == (ab)=((b)errorcorrection)|cosine simularity of a = b
